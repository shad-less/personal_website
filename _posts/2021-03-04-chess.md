# New Game #
Recently, I've started playing chess on [Chess.com](chess.com). Chess is something I've played sparingly my whole life, but have played a bit more in recent years. 
In these years, a thing I've often said is that I was going to buy a chess book and learn how to actually play. I haven't actually done that yet. But I did listen to 
an [Odd Lots episode](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-01-06/chess-grandmaster-hikaru-nakamura-on-twitch-streaming-podcast) featuring Hikaru Nakamura. I was intrigued by chess streaming, as streaming is a trend I haven't really consumed until recently. I ended up finding some Youtube videos from [GothamChess](https://www.youtube.com/c/GothamChess/about), and found them really helpful in starting to understand the chess basics. [ChessCoachNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjz7iEAs1g) is another good streamer whose videos I like. I'm a bad player, currently in the low 700s for rapid chess (10 minutes, my usual gameplay), but have had a lot of fun playing and learning a bit. I have two tips to have a lot of fun on chess.com. 
1. Make use of en-passant and castling as often as possible. These moves are magic and I love the joy of feeling like I'm getting away with something. 
2. Block amply. I've had a few cases I had to report vulgar usernames, but I usually block for a much less sinister reason: early resignation. Maybe they have their reasons, but I can't stand when my opponent resigns after an early queen loss or being down a bit in material. I'm a bad player, I'll probably squander my advantage! The block makes me feel good, I won't stand to play such weak-minded players. To get something out of it, I'll hit the analysis tab, fast-forward to the last move of the game, and finish vs. the computer. I like that it helps me learn to how win from advantageous positions, and it makes me chuckle when I blunder those positions into a draw.

If you want to play some chess, [add me](https://www.chess.com/member/birdhouse22) and let's play a game or two sometime.
