# How it Started
I've wanted to make my own website and blog for awhile now, so taking advantage of a COVID inspiration period to go ahead and do it. 
Starting the website will let me do some posting, but mainly will be a fun oppurtunity to learn and practice Git, web domains and hosting, CSS/HTML, and all that. 
We'll see where it goes, maybe I end up in a year letting my domain expire, maybe I'll be re-upping it and starting something else too. 

## First Steps
I'd heard about using Jekyll and GithubPages to start a simple website, so I logged on to Github and made a new repository. From here, it was super simple to pick a theme
and publish the site. The site will be hosted on *username*.github.io, which is clean enough, and the pre-set theme options are pretty sleek. <\br> While *username*.github.io
wasn't the worst domain name for my new website, I found it a bit boring. For most accounts I've set up in my life, I've left the naming decision to one of a few schemes:
1. Looking around the room and picking the first object I see
1. Using some combination of first and last initials or name
1. Letting the site's username generator pick one for me 

I decided that for my own website, my first blog, I wanted a better domain name. The GoDaddy advertisments of the 00's Super Bowls had staying power on my pre-teen brain,
so I knew that was a place I could buy a domain name. *Smalls* was my first search, being the most pleasant of nicknames I've had over the years (My last name led to some
quite unsavory nicknames). GoDaddy had **smalls.world** available for only $1.99 for a year, and $40.99 a year after that, and I thought that was a neat name. So I bought it.

## Getting it all set up
### The Domain
**smalls.world** in hand, I realized I had zero idea what to do next. Well shit. Not to worry, I'm fairly recent at reading docs and tutorials. I found [this Github 
tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) and started reading. Seemed easy enough I guess,
but it didn't quite click. I got to Googling (DuckDuckGoing, though more accurate, doens't sound right) and came across [Kirsten Swanson's guide](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b)
on setting up a GoDaddy domain with Github pages. This filled in all the gaps I had and the new domain was set up swiftly (though I had to wait overnight to check the 'Enable HTTPS' button on Github).

### The Site
In my first iteration, I just used the built in themes and it was nice enough. But in this manner, almost all of the site structure was hidden, and was just handled by the
Github-Jekyll build process (technically incorrect I'm sure). I knew it was possible to edit things by adding my own files to the repository (technically overriding the theme files),
but it was hard to tell what my options were and what changes would get me what I want. So I scrapped it all and started from scratch. <\br>
I started with installing Ruby, Jekyll and a few other key programs, following along with the [Jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/). 
Next, I followed along each step of the [Jekyll tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) and built out a basic website. This felt really helpful,
as I got two valuable things out of it: 1) A site with the navigation bar at the top 2) An understanding of how the themes, configs, defaults, posts, etc. all work together to
create a website. With this new knowledge I'm tempted to again start from scratch and use a template then augment it my changes, but I'm not going to do that. 
Either I don't learn CSS/HTML, Jekyll, Liquid and all that and have a website that's just black text on a white background, or I'll learn it and have a cool website.
Think I'm cool with it either way, will be fun wherever it goes. 

### What's next
- Learning CSS/HTML and making the site something more pleasant to look at
- Adding some content that someone besides me will want to read (or not, this is Smalls.World after all)
